# Pandas-Challenge

This script imports csv data containing information about player Screen names, Item purchased, transaction IDs, player gender, age, and the item purchase price.  Pandas is then used to determine the number of unique Screen names, break down purchase data by gender and age demographics.  The data is further evaluated to determine the top spenders, most popular items, and the most profitable items.
